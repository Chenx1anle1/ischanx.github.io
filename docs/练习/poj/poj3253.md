## **题目描述-Description**
Farmer John wants to repair a small length of the fence around the pasture. He measures the fence and finds that he needs N (1 ≤ N ≤ 20,000) planks of wood, each having some integer length Li (1 ≤ Li ≤ 50,000) units. He then purchases a single long board just long enough to saw into the N planks (i.e., whose length is the sum of the lengths Li). FJ is ignoring the "kerf", the extra length lost to sawdust when a sawcut is made; you should ignore it, too.

FJ sadly realizes that he doesn't own a saw with which to cut the wood, so he mosies over to Farmer Don's Farm with this long board and politely asks if he may borrow a saw.

Farmer Don, a closet capitalist, doesn't lend FJ a saw but instead offers to charge Farmer John for each of the N-1 cuts in the plank. The charge to cut a piece of wood is exactly equal to its length. Cutting a plank of length 21 costs 21 cents.

Farmer Don then lets Farmer John decide the order and locations to cut the plank. Help Farmer John determine the minimum amount of money he can spend to create the N planks. FJ knows that he can cut the board in various different orders which will result in different charges since the resulting intermediate planks are of different lengths.
### **输入-Input**
Line 1: One integer N, the number of planks
Lines 2..N+1: Each line contains a single integer describing the length of a needed plank
```
3
8
5
8
```
### **输出-Output**
Line 1: One integer: the minimum amount of money he must spend to make N-1 cuts
```
34
```
### **提示-Hint**
He wants to cut a board of length 21 into pieces of lengths 8, 5, and 8.
The original board measures 8+5+8=21. The first cut will cost 21, and should be used to cut the board into pieces measuring 13 and 8. The second cut will cost 13, and should be used to cut the 13 into 8 and 5. This would cost 21+13=34. If the 21 was cut into 16 and 5 instead, the second cut would cost 16 for a total of 37 (which is more than 34).
## **分析思路**
砍长度为x的木头需要x元，现在给n个长度和一块长度刚刚好的木板给你，你要用最少的钱把这些长度的木头砍出来

思路当然是每次先把最长的木头砍了，这样下一次计算的时候肯定是最少的

**要注意的是砍的过程中，木头的长度序列是不断在变化的，所以每次的最长木头都可能不一样**

我用的是优先队列进行排列，将长度序列最大的两个长度先砍了

## **代码实现**
```cpp
#include "stdio.h"
#include <cstdio>
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

int main(){
    //data structure
    int n;
    int x;
    long long sum = 0;
    priority_queue<long long, vector<long long>, greater<long long> > q;
    //init
    scanf("%d",&n);
    for(int i = 0;i<n;i++){
        scanf("%d",&x);
        q.push(x);
        
    }
    //main
    if(n == 1){
        printf("%d\n",0);
        return 0;
    }else{
        while(q.size() >1){
            long long a = q.top();
            q.pop();
            long long b = q.top();
            q.pop();
            const long long temp = a+b;
            sum += temp;
            q.push(temp);
        }
        printf("%lld\n",sum);
    }
    return 0;
}
```
## **错误分析**
没有注意到过程中的序列动态变化，没有每次对木头序列进行排序
