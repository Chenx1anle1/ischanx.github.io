## **题目描述-Description**
FJ is about to take his N (1 ≤ N ≤ 2,000) cows to the annual"Farmer of the Year" competition. In this contest every farmer arranges his cows in a line and herds them past the judges.

The contest organizers adopted a new registration scheme this year: simply register the initial letter of every cow in the order they will appear (i.e., If FJ takes Bessie, Sylvia, and Dora in that order he just registers BSD). After the registration phase ends, every group is judged in increasing lexicographic order according to the string of the initials of the cows' names.

FJ is very busy this year and has to hurry back to his farm, so he wants to be judged as early as possible. He decides to rearrange his cows, who have already lined up, before registering them.

FJ marks a location for a new line of the competing cows. He then proceeds to marshal the cows from the old line to the new one by repeatedly sending either the first or last cow in the (remainder of the) original line to the end of the new line. When he's finished, FJ takes his cows for registration in this new order.

Given the initial order of his cows, determine the least lexicographic string of initials he can make this way.
### **输入-Input**
* Line 1: A single integer: N
* Lines 2..N+1: Line i+1 contains a single initial ('A'..'Z') of the cow in the ith position in the original line
```

A
C
D

```
### **输出-Output**
The least lexicographic string he can make. Every line (except perhaps the last one) contains the initials of 80 cows ('A'..'Z') in the new line.

### **提示-Hint**

## **分析思路**
给你几个十六进制的数字，将他们排列得到一个最小的十六进制数；但是**每一次只能在首部和尾部取数字**，而且**输出的时候一行只能有80个数位**

思路自然是：小数放在高位，大数放在低位，这样形成的数字一定是最小的。遇到首尾相同则两边的内侧数字同时比较，取最先出现小的那方（因为小的放高位，要优先输出）

## **代码实现**
```c
#include "stdio.h"
int main(){
    int n;
    char a[2005];//注意是字符数组
    while(~scanf("%d",&n)){
        getchar();
        for(int i = 0;i<n;i++){
            scanf("%c",&a[i]);
            getchar();
        }
        int left = 0;
        int right = n-1;
        int out = 0;
        while(left <= right){
            int equal = -1;
            int j = 0;
            while(left + j<=right - j){
                if(a[left + j] < a[right - j]){
                    break;
                }else if(a[left + j] > a[right - j]){
                    equal = 1;
                    break;
                }
                j++;
            }
            if(equal == -1){
                printf("%c",a[left++]);
            }else if(equal == 1){
                printf("%c",a[right--]);
            }
            out ++;
            if(out % 80 == 0)
                putchar('\n');
        }
        if(n < 80)
            putchar('\n');
    }
    return 0;
}
```
