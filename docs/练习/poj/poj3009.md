## **题目描述-Description**

On Planet MM-21, after their Olympic games this year, curling is getting popular. But the rules are somewhat different from ours. The game is played on an ice game board on which a square mesh is marked. They use only a single stone. The purpose of the game is to lead the stone from the start to the goal with the minimum number of moves.

Fig. 1 shows an example of a game board. Some squares may be occupied with blocks. There are two special squares namely the start and the goal, which are not occupied with blocks. (These two squares are distinct.) Once the stone begins to move, it will proceed until it hits a block. In order to bring the stone to the goal, you may have to stop the stone by hitting it against a block, and throw again.

Fig. 1: Example of board (S: start, G: goal)

The movement of the stone obeys the following rules:

- At the beginning, the stone stands still at the start square.
- The movements of the stone are restricted to x and y directions. Diagonal moves are prohibited.
- When the stone stands still, you can make it moving by throwing it. You may throw it to any direction unless it is blocked immediately(Fig. 2(a)).
- Once thrown, the stone keeps moving to the same direction until one of the following occurs:
  - The stone hits a block (Fig. 2(b), (c)).
    - The stone stops at the square next to the block it hit.
    - The block disappears.
  - The stone gets out of the board.
    - The game ends in failure.
  - The stone reaches the goal square.
    - The stone stops there and the game ends in success.
- You cannot throw the stone more than 10 times in a game. If the stone does not reach the goal in 10 moves, the game ends in failure.

Fig. 2: Stone movements

Under the rules, we would like to know whether the stone at the start can reach the goal and, if yes, the minimum number of moves required.

With the initial configuration shown in Fig. 1, 4 moves are required to bring the stone from the start to the goal. The route is shown in Fig. 3(a). Notice when the stone reaches the goal, the board configuration has changed as in Fig. 3(b).

### **输入-Input**

The input is a sequence of datasets. The end of the input is indicated by a line containing two zeros separated by a space. The number of datasets never exceeds 100.

Each dataset is formatted as follows.

the width(=w) and the height(=h) of the board
First row of the board
...
h-th row of the board

The width and the height of the board satisfy: 2 <= w <= 20, 1 <= h <= 20.

Each line consists of w decimal numbers delimited by a space. The number describes the status of the corresponding square.

> 0	vacant square
> 1	block
> 2	start position
> 3	goal position

The dataset for Fig. D-1 is as follows:

> 6 6
> 1 0 0 2 1 0
> 1 1 0 0 0 0
> 0 0 0 0 0 3
> 0 0 0 0 0 0
> 1 0 0 0 0 1
> 0 1 1 1 1 1

```
### **输出-Output**

For each dataset, print a line having a decimal integer indicating the minimum number of moves along a route from the start to the goal. If there are no such routes, print -1 instead. Each line should not have any character other than this number.

## **分析思路**

冰壶运动，这里简称丢球。向上下左右任意方向丢球，球遇到墙壁（x+1）会停止，墙会碎，然后在x处重新丢球。具体过程可以看样例的图，看图很快就能懂。

现在想找**十次以内**至少丢球多少次能到达目标点。

由于一次可以走多步，而且需要记录状态（墙碎不碎），所以BFS比较麻烦（能不能实现不是很清楚 => **故采用DFS**

**注意：输入是列和行，顺序比较坑**

## **代码实现**
```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <cmath>
#include <algorithm>
#include <queue>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cstdlib>
#define eps 1e-6
#define ll long long
#define INF 0x3f3f3f3f
using namespace std;

void bfs();
int map[25][25];//map
int row,col;
int firstRow,firstCol;
int lastRow,lastCol;
int dx[] = {0,0,1,-1};
int dy[] = {1,-1,0,0};
int ans;

void dfs(int x,int y ,int step){
    //超过目前最短或超过最长限制
    if(step > 10|| step >= ans)
        return;

    //四个方向丢球
    for(int i = 0;i<4;i++){
        int nextx = x ;
        int nexty = y ;
        //丢球点前的第一个点不能为障碍物
        if(map[nextx + dx[i]][nexty + dy[i]] == 1)
            continue;
        //模拟球的滑行过程
        while(nextx + dx[i] < row && nextx + dx[i]>=0 && nexty + dy[i] < col && nexty + dy[i] >= 0){
            if(map[nextx + dx[i]][nexty + dy[i]] == 0 || map[nextx + dx[i]][nexty + dy[i]] == 2){
                nextx += dx[i];
                nexty += dy[i];
            }else if(map[nextx + dx[i]][nexty + dy[i]] == 3){
                ans = min(ans,step);
                break;
            }else{
                //撞墙，墙破碎，球停止
                map[nextx + dx[i]][nexty + dy[i]] = 0;
                dfs(nextx,nexty,step + 1);
                map[nextx + dx[i]][nexty + dy[i]] = 1;
                break;
            }
        }
    }
}
int main(){
    while(cin>>col>>row){
        ans = INF;
        if(!row&& !col){
            break;
        }
        for(int i = 0;i<row;i++){
            for(int j = 0;j<col;j++){
                cin>>map[i][j];
                if(map[i][j] == 2){
                    firstRow = i;
                    firstCol = j;
                }else if(map[i][j] == 3){
                    lastRow = i;
                    lastCol = j;
                }
            }
        }
        dfs(firstRow,firstCol,1);
        if(ans == INF)
            cout<<-1<<endl;
        else cout<<ans<<endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```
## **错误分析**
一开始以为就一道起点到终点最短路径的题，直接码了个bfs模板调参数，结果发现出现大问题。他这个不是一步步走的，一次可以走多步，人都傻了。题目本身不是很难，就是思路不能一下子调整过来，写dfs的时候考虑各种情况容易把自己绕进去
